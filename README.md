## About me 

<img src="https://github.com/faraimazh/faraimazhandu.github.io/blob/main/images/CUboulder.jpeg">

I am the Founder President of OneQuantum Africa, [OneQuantum](https://onequantum.org/) and Co-founder of [Bayete Quantum Technologies](http://bayetequantum.tech/), the leading enabler of quantum tech in Africa through platforms, insights, training, and matchmaking.

You can learn more about our vision for Africa here [BQT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bayete-quantum-technologies/about/?viewAsMember=true)

I am also a physics PhD student at the [Colorado School of Mines](https://quantumcreep.mines.edu/people/) - a background that has unlocked a great career for me at the nexus of bleeding-edge research and impact, one that has taken me around the world, and to high profile roles across academia, technology, and the built environment, I am also a co-founder and non-executive director at [Frontline Contracting](http://frontlinecontracting.co.za/) where I advise on strategic innovation and digital transformation in the construction industry using IoT, AI, Machine Learning, and Quantum Computing.

## Call-To-Action
Africa can now tap into a rich seam of advanced technology solutions that are being explored globally, opening up fresh ways to measure, process and transmit information. The continent cannot simply cannot afford to be left out of the quantum revolution which will sit at the core of building new enterprises, future careers, and workforces as well as driving accessible innovation.

I am inspired to encourage African entrepreneurs, investors, students, and officials to contribute in key roles as the sector steadily progresses toward commercial viability. My passion is to adapt and apply emerging technologies to solve unique problems bedeviling the continent.

## Contributions
As a data geek and [Qiskit Advocate](https://qiskit.org/advocates) (achieved through testing and certification), I have been invited to participate in the inaugural Quantum Computing Summer School (sponsored by WitsQ and IBM) and [Qiskit Camp Africa Hackathon](https://qiskit.org/events/africa/) (where I adapted my MSc project on NV centres and came up as first runner-up) in 2019. I have published in refereed journals, featured on panels with global thought leaders in technology (was recently on the panel on Building a Community with Open Source at the [IBM Quantum Summit 2020](https://ibm.6connex.com/event/quantumsummit/login) and judging panel for [Qiskit Hackathon Global 2020](https://qiskithackathon.global.bemyapp.com/#/event), and presented diverse workshops and lectures, as well as authored articles covering; IoT [read my publications here](https://www.iotforall.com/author/faraimazhandu) and quantum computing [read some of my contributions here](https://medium.com/@faraimazhandu).

I devote much of my free time to philanthropy - contributing and volunteering to the community and am currently building an African quantum tech community through the OneQuantum Africa chapter and serve in many organizations in Africa and beyond.

My story is a testament to the power of being a global citizen and true thought leader â€“ working every day to make a positive impact while also helping organizations understand and implement disruptive technologies that are fast reshaping the world around us.
